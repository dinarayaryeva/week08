When we want to somehow optimize usage of RAM in our system or there is not enought memory to allocate for the next process, we can use virtual memory approach.  System shrinks our memory into small parts and maps processes' address spases into different parts (pages) that can partially be on the disk, even if process runs. When virtual memory is used, in order to access it MMU (Memory Management Unit) maps the virtual addresses onto the physical memory addresses using page table. If mapped address is not in the RAM, it causes page fault.
